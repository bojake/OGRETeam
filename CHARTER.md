# OpenGovCon OGRE Team Charter



## 1. Mission



The OpenGovCon OGRE Team exists to publish and maintain open reference implementations of government contracting compliance systems.

The objective is to make compliance enforceable through transparent controls, test harnesses, and reproducible evidence packages, rather than vendor lock-in.

## 2. Guiding Principles

OpenGovCon projects shall be:

- **Evidence-driven**: compliance controls must produce reproducible outputs.

- **Clause-mapped**: regulatory and contractual requirements must map directly to controls.

- **Test-validated**: every major compliance control must have an automated test case.

- **Auditor-readable**: outputs must be understandable by auditors, accountants, and management.

- **Vendor-neutral**: systems must not depend on proprietary vendor ecosystems.
