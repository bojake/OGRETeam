# OGRE Team (Open GovCon Revenue Engineering Team)

OGRE Team is the governance and steering committee repository for the OpenGovCon initiative.

This repository defines the mission, charter, governance rules, contributor policies, and
project roadmap for OpenGovCon’s open compliance reference implementations.

## Purpose

Government contracting compliance systems are expensive largely due to market capture,
vendor lock-in, and compliance ambiguity.

OpenGovCon exists to publish open, testable, evidence-driven reference implementations
that allow organizations to build compliant operational systems without being trapped
in closed ecosystems.

## Repositories

- **OGRETeam** (this repo): governance and steering committee documents
- **ReferenceAccountingSystem**: the DCAA / DFARS accounting system reference implementation

## Scope of OGRETeam

This repository contains:
- Steering committee charter and governance rules
- Project roadmaps and decision records
- Trademark and branding policies
- Security and disclosure processes

This repository does NOT contain source code for compliance engines.
